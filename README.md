Introducing the mmWave sensor by Sensy-One ‚Äì the smallest and most powerful mmWave sensor on the market. After four months of prototyping, fine-tuning the firmware, and testing, we have developed a sensor that sets a new performance standard. It delivers near-instant motion detection, exceptional accuracy, and seamless Home Assistant integration. [Explore on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-Rij8gbK3s)

## ‚ú® Standout Specs

**Instant Home Assistant Integration**  

The sensor features built-in auto-discovery via the BLE Improv protocol, so it‚Äôs instantly recognized by Home Assistant as soon as it‚Äôs powered on. No BLE? No problem! It automatically switches to AP mode for an effortless, rock-solid integration.

**Precision Motion Tracking**  

Track up to three targets simultaneously in real time. The Hi-Link LD2450 accurately detects X and Y coordinates, movement speed, and more, with a 6-meter range, 120¬∞ field of view, and a 35¬∞ pitch angle. Whether detecting subtle movements or following dynamic motion, you can count on precise, reliable performance.

**Customizable Detection Zones**  

Our sensor offers flexible monitoring with three detection zones and one exclusion zone. Each detection zone comes with three dedicated sensors that measure movement, presence, and target count, providing detailed insight into activity. Adjustable motion thresholds and timeouts allow you to fine-tune the sensor‚Äôs sensitivity and response, ensuring optimal performance in any environment.

**Power-Packed Performance**  

Under the hood, the sensor is driven by the ESP32-S3 Pico microcontroller, boasting dual-core processing and an optimized Wi-Fi module. That means faster response times, real-time data processing, and rock-solid performance for lightning-fast, ultra-reliable automations.

**Compact Design**  

At just 25 mm √ó 25 mm √ó 50 mm, this sensor proves that big performance comes in a small package. The rotating wall mount, complete with an adhesive strip for easy installation, lets you direct the sensor exactly where you need it. Available in sleek black or crisp white, it becomes even slimmer, down to 20 mm in thickness when you remove the wall mount for an even subtler installation.

## ‚ö° From Power On to Home Assistant

Power your sensor with any 5V supply via its USB-C port. It only needs a little juice to get started. Once powered, the sensor automatically tries to connect to your Home Assistant system.

**For Home Assistant Systems with BLE:**  
- The sensor will appear under **Devices and Services** as **Discovered**.
- Click **Add** and enter your Wi-Fi credentials to connect it to your network.

**For Home Assistant Systems without BLE:**  
- The sensor will create its own access point named **I am Sensy!**.
- Connect to the AP and visit `http://192.168.4.1` in your browser.
- Enter your Wi-Fi credentials and click **Save**.
- Once connected, the sensor will appear under **Devices and Services** as **Discovered**.

## üìä Real-Time Visualization with Plotly Graph Card

Add an interactive map to your Home Assistant dashboard. The Plotly Graph Card automatically displays live target positions, speeds, and any zones you‚Äôve configured. Offering at-a-glance insights into every movement.

**Install HACS and the Plotly Graph Card**  
- If you haven‚Äôt already installed HACS, follow the [Official instructions](https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/use/download/download/).
- Once HACS is installed, open it in Home Assistant.
- Search for and install the **Plotly Graph Card** integration.

**Add a Custom Plotly Graph Card**  
- Go to your Home Assistant dashboard and click **Edit Dashboard**.
- Select **Add Card** and choose **Plotly Graph Card**.
- Click **Show Code Editor** to open the YAML configuration editor.
- Copy and paste the custom configuration from the [Git repository](https://github.com/sensy-one/mmwave-sensor/blob/main/assets/config/) into the editor.

**Replace the Placeholder IDs**  
- Use your text editor‚Äôs find & replace feature (usually **Ctrl+F** on Windows or **Command+F** on Mac) to locate any `replace_me` placeholders in the YAML configuration.
- Replace them with your sensor name. By default, this might be `sensy_one_1617c8`. If you renamed the sensor (e.g., ‚ÄúLiving Room‚Äù), use `living_room`.
- If you see a **Visual editor not supported** message, you can safely ignore it. This is normal for custom cards.

## üìç Get in the Zone

Set up custom zones right from your Home Assistant dashboard. Our sensor provides 3 detection zones and 1 exclusion zone. Each zone reports a presence sensor, a movement sensor, and a target count sensor. Giving you all the data you need to trigger precise, zone-based automations.

**Set Horizontal Boundaries**  
- **X Begin**: Enter the leftmost coordinate of your zone.  
- **X End**: Enter the rightmost coordinate of your zone.

**Set Vertical Boundaries**  
- **Y Begin**: Enter the top coordinate of your zone.  
- **Y End**: Enter the bottom coordinate of your zone.

**Example Configuration**  
- **X Begin**: -125
- **X End**: 125
- **Y Begin**: 175  
- **Y End**: 425  

## üîÑ Firmware on the Fly

Keep your sensor up to date with regular OTA updates. We continuously refine performance and add new functionalities to keep your sensor reliable and current.

**Install OTA Updates**  
- Download the latest ota firmware from our [Git repository](https://github.com/sensy-one/mmwave-sensor/tree/main/assets/firmware/ota).
- Go to **Devices and Services** and select **ESPHome**. Choose the sensor you want to update.  
- Under **Device Info**, click **Visit** to open the sensor‚Äôs web server.
- Scroll down to the **OTA Update**, choose the downloaded firmware file, and click **Update**.  
  *(If the update page times out, simply refresh the page.)*

## üîß Troubleshooting

Even the most cutting-edge tech can have its off moments. If your sensor isn‚Äôt performing exactly as expected, don‚Äôt worry. A quick factory reset might be all you need for a fresh start.

**Install Factory Firmware**  
- Download the latest factory firmware from our [Git repository](https://github.com/sensy-one/mmwave-sensor/tree/main/assets/firmware/factory).  
- Plug the sensor into your PC via USB-C.  
- Open the [Official ESPHome Web Wizard](https://web.esphome.io/?dashboard_wizard).  
- Click **Connect** and select the appropriate COM port for your sensor.  
- Click **Install**, choose the downloaded firmware file, and click **Install** once more.
